# Worksheet Coverage Matrix

This file tracks specification coverage vs worksheets and guides tidy/expansion work. The target is about 50 worksheets per subject, flexing as needed to cover the full spec.

## Plan (All Science)
1) Build a full spec checklist from [specifications/science.html](specifications/science.html).
2) Map each worksheet to spec items with a 0-3 coverage score.
3) Tidy: remove off-spec content, fix scope labels, normalize structure, and keep questions introductory.
4) Expand: create missing worksheets to cover every spec item, with light practical-style questions.
5) Update [worksheets/index.html](worksheets/index.html) to reflect the new coverage map.
6) QA: verify each worksheet maps cleanly to a defined spec chunk.

Coverage score key:
- 0 = Missing
- 1 = Mentioned only
- 2 = Directly tested (intro level)
- 3 = Fully covered with varied question types

# Physics Coverage (Completed)

All physics specification items in [specifications/science.html](specifications/science.html) are now directly addressed in the physics worksheets. Each topic includes explicit unit questions, introductory calculations, and at least one practical-style prompt where required.

## Worksheet Map
- Topic 1: [worksheets/physics/1.1_forces_motion.html](worksheets/physics/1.1_forces_motion.html), [worksheets/physics/1.2_momentum_collisions.html](worksheets/physics/1.2_momentum_collisions.html)
- Topic 2: [worksheets/physics/2.1_electricity_circuits.html](worksheets/physics/2.1_electricity_circuits.html)
- Topic 3: [worksheets/physics/3.1_waves_radiation.html](worksheets/physics/3.1_waves_radiation.html), [worksheets/physics/3.2_light_optics.html](worksheets/physics/3.2_light_optics.html)
- Topic 4: [worksheets/physics/4.1_energy_resources.html](worksheets/physics/4.1_energy_resources.html)
- Topic 5: [worksheets/physics/5.1_thermodynamics.html](worksheets/physics/5.1_thermodynamics.html)
- Topic 6: [worksheets/physics/6.1_magnetism_electromagnetism.html](worksheets/physics/6.1_magnetism_electromagnetism.html)
- Topic 7: [worksheets/physics/7.1_nuclear.html](worksheets/physics/7.1_nuclear.html)
- Topic 8: [worksheets/physics/8.1_astrophysics.html](worksheets/physics/8.1_astrophysics.html)

## QA Checklist (Physics)
- Each worksheet matches its spec range and includes intro-level questions only.
- Practical-tagged specs are represented by a short practical-method question.
- No off-spec concepts remain.
