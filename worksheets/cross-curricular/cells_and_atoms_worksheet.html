        <strong>Common Misconception:</strong> Many students think that things are made EITHER of cells OR of atoms - that these are two completely different categories.<br><br>
        <strong>The Truth:</strong> Cells are MADE OF atoms! Everything is made of atoms. Living things organize atoms into molecules, and molecules into cells. Non-living things are made of atoms and molecules but NOT organized into cells.

        <p><strong>Student A:</strong> "Cheese is made from milk, which comes from cows. Cows are alive, so cheese must be made of cells."</p>
        <p><strong>Student B:</strong> "But cheese isn't alive anymore, so it's just made of atoms and molecules now, not cells."</p>
        
        <p><strong>a)</strong> Which student is more correct? Explain your reasoning.</p>
