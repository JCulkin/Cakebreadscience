        <strong>Key Concepts:</strong> A sequence is an ordered list of numbers. In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant (common difference d). In a geometric sequence, the ratio between consecutive terms is constant (common ratio r). A series is the sum of terms in a sequence.
